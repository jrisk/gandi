//MEMORY STORE

//npm install memorystore, express-session extension
//or use express-mysql-session
//Gandi may not allow in memory store
//req.session.key=req.body.email;
//client.set('c_key', req.session.key);

/*var RedisStore = require('connect-redis')(session);

var client = redis.createClient();

let redis_opts = {

watch v-if with this.$refs, even in mount method, it will not capture a ref if not mounted first with v-if=true

FIXED

vue login econnrefused server route register
chat app
webpack dev prod server workflow
change cross-env to --env flag
fix dev-server.js/server.js so not copy-pasting

git rm cached .env 
env file fugging up on prod, no error because cached before gitignore

neither is the previous workaround cross-env NODE_ENV=production webpack. Recent releases of Webpack, with almost no fanfare and uncharacteristically little documentation, solved the problem of injecting enviroment variables into the Webpack config, and the solution is far simpler than the vast majority of tutorials will suggest.

The command line option --env allows you to control as many variables as you like, such as --env.production or --env.platform=web, that will be accessible by the webpack config. You put in a simple check like:

// Set config defaults when creating the instance
const instance = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://api.example.com'
});
